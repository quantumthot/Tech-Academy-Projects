		<p>This I sat engaged in guessing,<br>
		But no syllable expressing<br>
		To the fowl whose <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">fiery</span> eyes now<br>
		Burned into my bosom's core;<br>
		This and more I sat divining,<br>
		With my head at ease reclining<br>
		On the cushion's velvet lining<br>
		That the lamplight gloated o'er,<br>
		But whose velvet <span style="color:violet; font-weight:bold">violet</span> lining,<br>
		With the lamplight gloating o'er<br>
		She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br>
	<p> &nbsp;Never          More!</p>
